Description: This package is the public version of the one which manages Zachary Burchill's pupillometry (eye-tracking) project. (The original is stored as part of a private repository on Bitbucket for confidentiality reasons.) This package has three primariy uses. First, it pre-processes the raw data (which has personally identifiable information and is thus stored on a secure remote server) when run on the data server so that the accessible data no longer has participant information in it. Second, it bundles this data together in a nice, portable package. Third, it provides a number of helpful functions to further process the eye-tracking data for analysis and plotting.
